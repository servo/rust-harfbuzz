[HarfBuzz](https://harfbuzz.github.io/) is a text shaping engine. It
solves the problem of selecting and positioning glyphs from a font
given a Unicode string.

This crate provides a higher level API (than the
[raw C bindings](https://crates.io/crates/harfbuzz-sys)).

## Features

- `freetype` - Enables bindings to the FreeType font engine. (Enabled by default.)
- `coretext` - Enables bindings to the CoreText font engine. (Apple platforms only) (Enabled by default.)
- `directwrite` - Enables bindings to the DirectWrite font engine. (Windows only) (Enabled by default.)
